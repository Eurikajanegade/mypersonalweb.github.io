<pre><font face="Arial">
				  One of the major reasons business, home, and other users purchase computers is for Internet access. The Internet is a widely used research tool, providing society with access<br>
			to global information and instant communications. Further, access to the Internet can occur anytime from a computer anywhere: at home, at work, at school, in a restaurant, on an<br>
			airplane, and at a park.<br><br>
				  The Internet, also called the Net, is a worldwide collection of networks that links millions of businesses, government agencies, educational institutions, and individuals. Each of the<br>
			networks on the Internet provides sources that add to the abundance of goods, services, and information accesible via the Internet. <br><br>
				  Today, more than one billion home and business users around the world access a variety of services on the  Internet. The World Wide Wed, or simply  the Web, and e-mail are two<br>
			of the more widely used Internet services. Other services include chat rooms, instant messaging, and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol.)

				  <b>HTML</b> stands for <b><i>Hyper Text Markup Language.</b></i> It is used to design web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of HyperText and Markup<br>
			language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. Markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language<br>
			is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most of markup (eg. HTML) languages are human readable.<br>
			Language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.<br><br>
				  HTML is a markup langauge which is used by the browser to manipulate text, images and other content to display it in required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.<br>
			The first ever version of HTML was HTML 1.O but the first standard version was HTML 2.0 which was published in 1999.

			HTML - TEXT
</b></p></u></pre></font>
<pre><font face="Arial">
				  Text is the backbone of any web page. It plays a double role; it provides content for web surfers to enjoy as they skim through articles and articles of information, but it also gives<br>
			Search Engines and Spiders keywords and meta data. It is because of text on web pages that we have a network of seemingly endless information available at our fingers.

			HTML - Paragraph Text
</b></p></u></pre></font>
<pre><font face="Arial">
				  Any text containing more than a few lines (or sometimes even more) should exist inside of a paragraph tag < p >. This tag is reserved specifically for blocks of text, such as those you<br>
			would expect to find inside your favorite novel.
